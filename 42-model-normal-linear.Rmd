# The normal linear model

$$ y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_t + \varepsilon_t $$

## Assumptions of the linear model

* Relationship between predictor $x$ and predictand $y$ is linear.
* Both $x$ and $y$ are known, observed without error.

* Errors have mean zero.
* Errors are independent of each other.  
* Errors are uncorrelated with predictor variables $x_t$.

Often, assume stronger additional conditions that errors are *independent, identically normally distributed*: for all $t$, $\varepsilon_t \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$. for a constant $\sigma^2$.

In compact vector and matrix notation, we may write: 

$$ 
Y = X \beta + \varepsilon,
\quad \text{where $\varepsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2 I_T)$} 
$$
