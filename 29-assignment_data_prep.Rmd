# Assignment: Prepare your data


This assignment focuses on the steps needed to clean, organize, and prepare your data set for time series analysis. You are asked to:

1. Read the data into R
1. Organize the data into a *tidy* data frame.
1. Clean the data and perform various data quality checks
2. Convert this data frame into a `tsibble` object to render it ready for time series analysis.
3. Generate at least one table or graph based on the data (more if you like).



## Generate at least one table or figure

This step simply confirms that you have completed the preparation process and that your data is ready to analyze. You could for example simply add a line of code: `print([name_of_your_tsibble])` to generate a simple table.
