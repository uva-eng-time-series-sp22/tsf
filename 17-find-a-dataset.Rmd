## Appropriate data sets for time series analysis

Just because your data set has some dates and times in it, doesn't mean it is appropriate for a time series analysis.

Time series methods are generally appropriate when data are measured at regular intervals, over a fairly long period.

## Data resources

The UVA Libraries offer excellent [data services](https://www.library.virginia.edu/services), including resources for [data discovery and access](https://data.library.virginia.edu/datasources/). If you haven't settled on your own dataset to analyze for your project, you may find one by browsing their [recommended top data sources](https://data.library.virginia.edu/datasources/find-data/) and [licensed data](https://data.library.virginia.edu/datasources/licensed/). If you need personal assistance, you are invited to contact UVA's Data Librarian, Jenn Huck, at data@virginia.edu to schedule an appointment. 

Some data sources you might check out:

* The [Cross-National Time-Series Data Archive](https://data.library.virginia.edu/datasources/licensed/cnts/) provides more than 200 years of annual data from 1815 onward for over 200 countries. It consists of 196 data variables used by academia, government, finance and media.
* [U.S. Energy Information Administration](https://www.eia.gov/tools/). Diverse datasets on energy.
