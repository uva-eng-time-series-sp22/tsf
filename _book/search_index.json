Examples of using your model: Generate a forecast of future events Estimate the probability of a future event \\(\\ldots\\) Example problem: Estimating the probability of a weather event A pub owner in Charlottesville plans to sell beer outside on St. Patrick’s Day, March 17. The pub owner must decide whether to arrange to rent a supplemental refrigeration system for the day. Supplemental refrigeration offers a form of insurance. If temperatures outside on March 17 are high and the pub owner has not arranged supplemental refrigeration, she will be left with warm beer that she will have difficulty selling, leading to financial losses. Conversely, if she pays for supplemental refrigeration when temperatures are low, she will have incurred an unnecessary expense. To decide whether to insure herself against loss, she wishes to estimate the probability distribution of temperatures on March 17. 2.2 1. State your question 1. What is the probability that the high temperature on March 17 will exceed 23 degrees Celsius? 2.3 2. Acquire data and background information Get historical temperature data.

Perform exploratory analysis of your data hist(y, breaks = 20, main = &quot;Histogram of historical temperatures in degrees C&quot;) boxplot(y) 2.6 5. Write down your model of the data generating process It is supposed that these data were generated as independent, identically distributed random draws from a normal distribution: for \\(t = 1, \\ldots, n\\), \\[y_t = \\theta + \\varepsilon_t\\] where \\(\\theta\\) denotes the true but unobserved value of the long-run average temperature, and where \\(\\varepsilon_t \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2_\\varepsilon)\\). 2.6.1 Comments on this statistical model: The risk of model mis-specification This model asserts several substantive assumptions about the data generating process. The process is assumed to be stationary. There is no upward trend over time, no long-term climate change, etc. Temperatures are assumed to be independent from one year to the next. In particular, there is no autocorrelation. Knowing that one year’s temperature was unusually high (say) provides no information about the likelihood that next year’s temperature will also be unusually high. Inter-annual climate cycles (e.g., due to \\(El\\ Ni\\tilde{n}o\\)) are ruled out. Temperature variations around the long-run average are assumed to be identically distributed. This assumption rules out the possibility that variance is, say, greater when temperatures are higher than when they are lower. And others. In general, it is important to formulate a statistical model that accurately reflects the true characteristics of the underlying data generating process. When your statistical model is mis-specified, your probabilistic forecast of future events are likely to stray from the true underlying probabilities. Model mis-specification can then lead to inaccurate estimates of the distribution of losses for each possible action. This error may in turn lead to selection of a sub-optimal action. A particular problem to guard against is the possibility to underestimate the likelihood of extreme events that could cause catastrophic losses. That said, your time on this Earth is limited. Depending on the decision problem and the stakes involved, refining your model to get sharper loss estimates may or may not be worth the bother. A reasonable approach is to start by first writing down a simple forecasting model that appears to capture the essence of the process as you understand it. On the basis of this simple model, generate first-cut probabilistic forecasts of uncertain events. Use these to generate estimated distributions of losses for each possible action in your action set. On that basis, use the specified decision criterion to derive an initial optimal decision rule. Then, go back and check things over more carefully. Review the realism of your statistical model, given your understanding of data generating process. Plot and examine the distribution of your prediction errors. Do your prediction errors appear to follow a pattern that matches what you would expect, given the assumptions you have made? If you find evidence that your prediction model is mis-specified, it may be worth it to go back and refine your model, and see if you generate different results. One very good idea is to perform a sensitivity analysis. How sensitive are your decision recommendations and outcomes to the assumptions you’ve built into your statistical model? If you are not highly confident in your statistical assumptions, and if those assumptions turn out to matter a lot for your recommendations and outcomes, then it could very well be worth the bother to revisit those assumptions, and investigate alternatives. On the other hand, if your decision recommendations are not highly sensitive to your statistical assumptions, then keeping your initial model may be defensible. The point of this work is not to build the best possible prediction system, bullet-proof against any statistical criticism. The point is to help people make good decisions – or at least, decisiions better than they would have made otherwise. Your time and other resources are limited. A good-enough model may be good enough. 2.7 6. If necessary: transform the model and data to make it ready for analysis Not needed here. Will consider many cases where it is. 2.8 7. Choose an appropriate technique for estimating model parameters, consistent with your assumptions about your data generating process For this case, ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation is just fine. 2.9 8.

Use knitr to generate a PDF output. Commit your saved .Rmd and .pdf files to your (local) repo, then push your changes to your repo on the course site on Github. When all is ready, submit your assignment on Collab. But don’t attach your pdf file. Instead, a link to your .pdf file on Github. Generate your output as a PDF rather than as HTML: Github makes is complicated to download and view .html files. 3.3 Choosing a topic Your topic might depend on which type of degree program you are in, and how far along you are in that program. If you are well along in a research-oriented graduate degree program, then you likely have already a fairly clear notion of the research question(s) you are addressing or plan to address, and the methods you will use to approach your question. Ideally, you will have already secured access to a time series data set that you hope to analyze. In this case, please describe the data set, and the type of useful information you hope to learn about it. If applicable, describe how this analysis could inform your research program. If you at the beginning stages of a research-oriented degree program, you likely have some idea of the topics and methods you will use, but may not have much idea of what data sets you will use or what insights you hope to extract from those data. In this case, please think about what kinds of time series data analysis might help advance your work. It is likely that a consultation with your research advisor will be helpful. Write about your research question(s), and how analysis of time series data might help your research program. Ideally, please try to identify a data set that you could use, and describe how you can access these data. If you are not in a research-oriented degree program, think about how a time series analysis could be applied to some aspect of your work, professional practice, or personal or career interests. If you don’t have any ideas at all, and are looking for help finding one, let me know. We will identify together a project idea and data set you can work with, possibly related to energy.

Please install the software as indicated on your local machine, and familiarize yourself with the associated documentation. Topics: R, R Studio, git, Github, Markdown, R Markdown, Tidyverse and tidyverts packages for R Assignment: Follow instructions in the course Computing setup guide. 5.1 The R programming language, and related resources We will do our coding in R, a programming language especially well-suited to statistical computing. Download and install R, v. 3.0.1+. Note: There is a later version, v. 4.0.2, in development, but you shouldn’t need it. R Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It offers a variety of utilities to enhance the experience of coding and generating documents. Download and install R Studio, v. 1.4.1+. Tidyverse is a collection of packages that extend the capabilities of R for doing data science. Install the Tidyverse packages for R: From the Console tab in R Studio (or from R running in a Terminal window), enter: install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) Alternatively, you may install packages via the Packages tab in R Studio. Optional: To learn how to wrangle and visualize data using the Tidyverse packages, you may find it useful to go through the Tidyverse Fundamentals with R modules on Datacamp. Datacamp also offers a range of other learning modules for developing data science skills in R. Tidyverts is a collection of R packages for time series analysis designed to work well with the Tidyverse packages. Each package in the tidyverts suite needs to be installed individually: From the Console tab in R Studio (or from R running in a Terminal window), enter: install.packages(c(&quot;tsibble&quot;, &quot;tsibbledata&quot;, &quot;feasts&quot;, &quot;fable&quot;)) You don’t need to install the tsibbletalk and fable.prophet packages; we probably won’t use them in this course. 5.2 Git and Github Reference: Happy Git and GitHub for the useR Git is software for version control. Github is a web service that provides remote storage and access to files via git. This setup greatly facilitates collaboration between multiple individuals working on the same code base. First watch this short YouTube video to get an orientation to git and Github: Git and GitHub for an Organized Project (STAT 545 Episode 2-A) from the University of British Columbia. Then install git on your machine and link it to your R Studio instance and your file repository on Github: Follow these instructions to download and install git and to link git with R Studio. A collection of files associated with a single project is in git-speak called a “repository” or “repo”. You should already have a basic repo set up for you on the course site on Github. The next step is to copy (“clone”) this remote repo to your local machine. Clone your course repo on Github to a new R Studio project on your local machine. Navigate to the course website on Github. Select your repo. Click on the green button labeled “Code”. Copy the URL. In the R Studio window, from the pull-down menu in the upper-right corner, select New Project..., Version Control, Git. Paste the URL into the dialog box labeled Repository URL. Optional: Change the name of the project folder, and the location of this folder on your local directory tree. Click on Create Project. The files from your remote repo should be copied to your local machine in a new folder with the name you chose. Optional: Download and install the Github desktop client, or an alternative GUI client. The git operations you need for this course can be managed within R Studio, from the Git tab. Some more advanced operations require using either a Terminal window, or a Git desktop client. As you get going, you will likely want to learn more about how to work with git and Github. Review the documentation for git and this Github Guide. Learn the basics. 5.3 Markdown and R Markdown Markdown is a markup language: a set of formatting instructions for rendering documents. R Markdown is an extension of Markdown that allows for embedding chunks of R code into a Markdown document. In this course, we will write our work in R Markdown within the R Studio environment, then use the knitr package to generate HTML and PDF output files. For a nice introduction to Markdown and R Markdown, watch the short YouTube video Reproducible Reports with R Markdown (STAT 545 Episode 3-A) from the University of British Columbia. As you proceed in creating your documents, you will probably want to access additional resources: From within R Studio, you can access an R Markdown Cheat Sheet via Help/Cheatsheets.

What’s your desired end point? Data ETL is a creative activity! (Your jobs are secure.) 8.1.1 Design your end point first (at least, in your head). Which columns? In which order? Which data types should the different columns have? For tsibble objects: Which column is the index? Must have date+time values, at regular intervals. Which columns contain key values? These are values that don’t change with time. Each value of the key corresponds to a distinct time series. Cannot have duplicate rows that share an index + key value. Remaining columns contain observational data: one row for each time step and key value. What data types should these be? Might choose to drop columns you aren’t going to use, to reduce clutter. 8.1.2 Typical structure for a time series data table: Date + time Series Value_1 Value_2 Value_3 2020-02-01 “Virginia” 33.57 29 “friendly” 2020-02-01 “Idaho” 0.22 18 “hostile” … … … … … index key [date] [fctr] [dbl] [int] [fctr] Then wrangle your data to get to your desired end point.

You probably don’t want to re-do all the data preparation steps each time you start work. If you are working with a small data file, then it is probably not a problem to re-run the code to prepare your data file: it only takes a second. But especially if you are working with a larger file, re-doing the data prep for each work session is a hassle. Instead, you may wish to separate your data preparation code into its own script, then save the resulting prepared file to disk. Then, when you sit down to do analytic work, you can load your prepared file directly into memory. 12.1 Fast file reading and writing: The arrow package For saving and reading larger files, I recommend using the feather format supported by the arrow package. Arrow’s functions read_feather() and write_feather() work much faster than the corresponding read-write functions in base R.

You are asked to: Identify a time series data set that you might use as the basis for your class project. Acquire the data from its source location, reproducibly. Organize the data into a specific format, called a tidy data frame. Convert this data frame into a particular type of object called a tsibble to render it ready for time series analysis. Generate at least one table or graph based on the data (more if you like). Create a new R Markdown document for this work, inside R Studio. Code and document all these steps in a single .Rmd file. All steps should be fully reproducible. This means: If I, or anyone, rerun the code in your R Markdown file and reknit the .Rmd file to generate a new PDF output, I should be able to execute all your computational steps and regenerate your PDF essentially exactly. To submit your work: knit your .Rmd file to generate a .pdf file. Push both the .Rmd and .pdf files to your Repo on Github, along with any supporting files. Submit your assignment on Collab, enclosing a link to your .pdf file on Github. Here’s some additional background and guidance on the assignment: 12.2 Overview: Extraction, transformation, and loading of data Before undertaking any data analysis project, you need to organize your data into a format to make it ready for analysis. Very commonly, the data you wish to work with will not come to you in a nice format that makes it ready to analyze. You typically will need first to extract your data from its original source (e.g., an Excel file, or cloud hosting service). Often it will be necessary to transform the data, applying a sequence of manipulations to get it into a nice format such as a single table. If you have saved your prepared table to a database or local file, your may finally need to load the data into memory on your working machine as a prelude to commence analysis. These steps together are the extract-transform-load (ETL) stage of a data analysis project. The bad news is that working data scientists generally report that the ETL stage is the most time-consuming part of a data science project. The good news is that the R tidyverse packages offer a number of helpful tools to somewhat ease the pain of ETL work, also known informally as data wrangling.1 12.3 Step 1: Identify a time series data set you want to work with Ideally, identify a data set that you that you might use as the basis for your class project. You need not necessarily commit at this time to using this data set for your project. However, bear in mind that you will in this assignment be investing time and effort in acquiring, cleaning, and organizing the data set. It is better for you if you invest that effort on the data set you will later analyze. Please do not use a data set that already come packaged with R or that is otherwise already cleaned up. The point of this assignment is to learn how to use tools from the Tidyverse and tidyverts packages when working with data you acquire “in the wild”. 12.4 Step 2: Acquire the data from its source location, reproducibly The ETL steps needed for a given project will depend on the nature of the data and on how they are originally organized. We can characterize how we want the data to look at the end of the ETL stage. To the extent possible, we want the data to be tidy. 12.5 Step 3 Organize your data into a tidy data frame Hadley Wickham (???) codifies the concept of tidy data: Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. A dataset is messy or tidy depending on how rows, columns and tables are matched up with observations, variables and types. In tidy data: Each variable forms a column. Each observation forms a row. Each type of observational unit forms a table. “Real datasets can, and often do, violate the three precepts of tidy data in almost every way imaginable. While occasionally you do get a dataset that you can start analysing immediately, this is the exception, not the rule.” In real life, the systems people and organizations use to collect, manage, and store data are governed by many priorities: end-user convenience, clarity of presentation, storage costs, processing speed, etc. Making data fit for analysis by data scientists is typically a minor consideration, if it is thought of at all. Expanding on the theme, Wickham identifies five of the most common problems with non-tidy, “messy” datasets: Column headers are values, not variable names. Multiple variables are stored in one column. Variables are stored in both rows and columns. Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table. A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables. The Tidyverse packages integrate a range of tools to help with transforming the messy data often encountered in the wild into tidy formats more suitable for analysis. See the Tidyverse website for an overview, or this Coursera course for more guidance. 12.6 Step 4: Convert your data into a tsibble object In this step of the assignment, you will convert your tidy data frame into a tsibble object. Doing so in effect tells R: “These data actually form a time series. One column, which I designate the index, contains time values, in equal intervals.” Taking this step enables the use of specific tools for data visualization, exploratory analysis, and forecasting for time series data. The tsibble package for R provides “a data infrastructure for tidy temporal data”. Review the documentation for instructions. 12.7 Step 5: Generate at least one table or figure This step simply confirms that you have completed the ETL process and that your data is ready to analyze. You could simply add a line of code: print([name_of_your_tsibble]) to generate a simple table. 12.8 Additional resources and next steps To learn how to wrangle and visualize data using the Tidyverse packages, you may find it useful to go through the Tidyverse Fundamentals with R modules on Datacamp, or the analogous course on Coursera. Datacamp also offers a range of other learning modules for developing data science skills in R. With your data organized into a tsibble object, you are positioned to do some exploratory data analysis, the topic of the next assignment. If you want to get a head start, check out the functions for data visualization and exploratory analysis of time series in the feasts package. Or work through the examples in Chapter 2 or Chapter 4 of Forecasting: Principles and Practice, 3rd ed. Announcement: One more week to revise &amp; resubmit data ETL assignment Many folks had issues, as we’ll discuss. To do: Finalize your concept note. State clearly the question(s) you will attempt to answer. Make sure this is a clear, answerable question. Don’t do “a study of…”. Make sure this is genuinely a question about a time series process. Imagine a metronome: each time you hear a ‘click’, another row of data values gets added to your table. Organize your data table(s) so that they ‘match’ your question. Make sure your data set is aligned with your question. 12.9 References “Wrangling” refers to work with cattle, sheep, and other livestock.↩︎ "],["exploratory-analysis-of-time-series-data.html", "Chapter 13 Exploratory analysis of time series data 13.1 Overview 13.2 Briefly characterize the dataset 13.3 Plot the time series 13.4 Sesaonal plots 13.5 Scatterplots", " Chapter 13 Exploratory analysis of time series data 13.1 Overview Readings: FPP, Sections 2.2–2.6.

Treat this assignment as a “dry run” for developing a proposal for a grant or fellowship application, or for your Ph.D. prospectus. Your proposal should include at least the following sections and information. Front matter: Descriptive title, your name, date, reference to “SYS 5581 Time Series &amp; Forecasting, Spring 2021”. Abstract: A very brief summary of the project. 19.1 Introduction Give a narrative description of the problem you are addressing, and the methods you will use to address it. Provide context: What is the question you are attempting to answer? Why is this question important? (Who cares?) How will you go about attempting to answer this question? This work addresses the question: Why do people not use probabilistic forecasts for decision-making? 19.2 The data and the data-generating process Describe the data set you will be analyzing, and where it comes from, how it was generated and collected. Identify the source of the data. Give a narrative description of the data-generating process: this piece is critical. Since these will be time series data: identify the frequency of the data series (e.g., hourly, monthly), and the period of record. 19.3 Exploratory data analysis Provide a brief example of the data, showing how they are structured. 19.4 Plot the time series. 19.5 Perform and report the results of other exploratory data analysis 19.5.1 STL decomposition vaelsales_tbl_ts %&gt;% model(STL(sales_GWh ~ trend(window=21) + season(window=&#39;periodic&#39;), robust = TRUE)) %&gt;% components() %&gt;% autoplot() vaelsales_tbl_ts %&gt;% mutate(ln_sales_GWh = log(sales_GWh)) %&gt;% model(STL(ln_sales_GWh ~ trend(window=21) + season(window=&#39;periodic&#39;), robust = TRUE)) %&gt;% components() %&gt;% autoplot() vaelsales_tbl_ts %&gt;% features(sales_GWh, feat_stl) ## # A tibble: 1 x 9 ## trend_strength seasonal_streng… seasonal_peak_y… seasonal_trough… spikiness ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 0.597 0.863 7 4 862916. ## # … with 4 more variables: linearity &lt;dbl&gt;, curvature &lt;dbl&gt;, stl_e_acf1 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # stl_e_acf10 &lt;dbl&gt; vaelsales_tbl_ts %&gt;% features(sales_GWh, feature_set(pkgs=&quot;feasts&quot;)) ## # A tibble: 1 x 48 ## trend_strength seasonal_streng… seasonal_peak_y… seasonal_trough… spikiness ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 0.597 0.863 7 4 862916. ## # … with 43 more variables: linearity &lt;dbl&gt;, curvature &lt;dbl&gt;, stl_e_acf1 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # stl_e_acf10 &lt;dbl&gt;, acf1 &lt;dbl&gt;, acf10 &lt;dbl&gt;, diff1_acf1 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # diff1_acf10 &lt;dbl&gt;, diff2_acf1 &lt;dbl&gt;, diff2_acf10 &lt;dbl&gt;, season_acf1 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # pacf5 &lt;dbl&gt;, diff1_pacf5 &lt;dbl&gt;, diff2_pacf5 &lt;dbl&gt;, season_pacf &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # zero_run_mean &lt;dbl&gt;, nonzero_squared_cv &lt;dbl&gt;, zero_start_prop &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # zero_end_prop &lt;dbl&gt;, lambda_guerrero &lt;dbl&gt;, kpss_stat &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # kpss_pvalue &lt;dbl&gt;, pp_stat &lt;dbl&gt;, pp_pvalue &lt;dbl&gt;, ndiffs &lt;int&gt;, ## # nsdiffs &lt;int&gt;, bp_stat &lt;dbl&gt;, bp_pvalue &lt;dbl&gt;, lb_stat &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # lb_pvalue &lt;dbl&gt;, var_tiled_var &lt;dbl&gt;, var_tiled_mean &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # shift_level_max &lt;dbl&gt;, shift_level_index &lt;dbl&gt;, shift_var_max &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # shift_var_index &lt;dbl&gt;, shift_kl_max &lt;dbl&gt;, shift_kl_index &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # spectral_entropy &lt;dbl&gt;, n_crossing_points &lt;int&gt;, longest_flat_spot &lt;int&gt;, ## # coef_hurst &lt;dbl&gt;, stat_arch_lm &lt;dbl&gt; 19.5.2 Fitting data to simple models global_economy %&gt;% model(trend_model = TSLM(GDP ~ trend())) -&gt; fit fit ## # A mable: 263 x 2 ## # Key: Country [263] ## Country trend_model ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;model&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan &lt;TSLM&gt; ## 2 Albania &lt;TSLM&gt; ## 3 Algeria &lt;TSLM&gt; ## 4 American Samoa &lt;TSLM&gt; ## 5 Andorra &lt;TSLM&gt; ## 6 Angola &lt;TSLM&gt; ## 7 Antigua and Barbuda &lt;TSLM&gt; ## 8 Arab World &lt;TSLM&gt; ## 9 Argentina &lt;TSLM&gt; ## 10 Armenia &lt;TSLM&gt; ## # … with 253 more rows fit %&gt;% filter(Country == &quot;Sweden&quot;) %&gt;% residuals() ## # A tsibble: 58 x 4 [1Y] ## # Key: Country, .model [1] ## Country .model Year .resid ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Sweden trend_model 1960 79973991821. ## 2 Sweden trend_model 1961 71110300270. ## 3 Sweden trend_model 1962 62306636078. ## 4 Sweden trend_model 1963 53581309752. ## 5 Sweden trend_model 1964 45596438566. ## 6 Sweden trend_model 1965 37551535271. ## 7 Sweden trend_model 1966 29425266377. ## 8 Sweden trend_model 1967 21418661066. ## 9 Sweden trend_model 1968 12930653974. ## 10 Sweden trend_model 1969 5268492989. ## # … with 48 more rows fit %&gt;% filter(Country == &quot;Sweden&quot;) %&gt;% residuals() %&gt;% autoplot(.resid) 19.5.3 Work with ln(GDP) global_economy %&gt;% filter(Country==&quot;Sweden&quot;) %&gt;% autoplot(log(GDP)) + ggtitle(&quot;ln(GDP) for Sweden&quot;) + ylab(&quot;$US billions&quot;) global_economy %&gt;% model(trend_model = TSLM(log(GDP) ~ trend())) -&gt; logfit logfit %&gt;% filter(Country == &quot;Sweden&quot;) %&gt;% residuals() %&gt;% autoplot() global_economy %&gt;% model(trend_model = TSLM(log(GDP) ~ log(Population))) -&gt; fit3 fit3 %&gt;% filter(Country == &quot;Sweden&quot;) %&gt;% residuals() %&gt;% autoplot() 19.6 Statistical model 19.6.1 Formal model of data-generating process Write down an equation (or set of equations) that represent the data-generating process formally. If applicable: describe any transformations of the data (e.g., differencing, taking logs) you need to make to get the data into a form (e.g., linear) ready for numerical analysis. What kind of process is it? \\(AR(p)\\)? White noise with drift? Something else? Write down an equation expressing each realization of the stochastic process \\(y_t\\) as a function of other observed data (which could include lagged values of \\(y\\)), unobserved parameters (\\(\\beta\\)), and an error term (\\(\\varepsilon_t\\)). Ex: \\[y = X\\cdot\\beta + \\varepsilon\\] Add a model of the error process. Ex: \\(\\varepsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2 I_T)\\). 19.6.2 Discussion of the statistical model Describe how the formal statistical model captures and aligns with the narrative of the data-generating process. Flag any statistical challenges raised by the data generating process, e.g. selection bias; survivorship bias; omitted variables bias, etc. 19.7 Plan for data analysis Describe what information you wish to extract from the data. Do you wish to… estimate the values of the unobserved model parameters? create a tool for forecasting? estimate the exceedance probabilities for future realizations of \\(y_t\\)? Describe your plan for getting this information. OLS regression? Some other statistical technique? If you can: describe briefly which computational tools you will use (e.g., R), and which packages you expect to draw on. 19.8 Submission requirements Prepare your proposal using Markdown . (You may find it useful to generate your Markdown file from some other tool, e.g. R Markdown in R Studio.) Submit your proposal by pushing it to your repo within the course organization on Github. When your proposal is ready, notify the instructor by also creating a submission for this assignment on Collab. Please also upload a PDF version of your proposal to Collab as part of your submission. 19.9 Comment Depending on your prior experience, you may find this assignment challenging. Treat this assignment as an opportunity to make progress on your own research program. Make your proposal as complete as you can. But note that this assignment is merely the First Draft. You will have more opportunity to refine your work over the next two months, in consultation with the instructor, your advisor, and your classmates. 19.10 References "],["evaluating-model-residuals.html", "Chapter 20 Evaluating model residuals 20.1 Model residuals vs. forecast errors 20.2 Are the model residuals auto-correlated? 20.3 Example: GDP, several models, several countries", " Chapter 20 Evaluating model residuals 20.1 Model residuals vs. forecast errors Model residuals: Your data: \\(y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_T\\) Fitted values: \\(\\hat{y}_1, \\hat{y}_2, \\ldots, \\hat{y}_T\\) Model residuals: \\(e_t = y_t - \\hat{y}_t\\) Forecast errors: augment(fit) ## # A tsibble: 15,150 x 7 [1Y] ## # Key: Country, .model [263] ## Country .model Year GDP .fitted .resid .innov ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan trend_model 1960 537777811. -1587934559. 2125712370. 2.13e9 ## 2 Afghanistan trend_model 1961 548888896. -1281158073. 1830046968. 1.83e9 ## 3 Afghanistan trend_model 1962 546666678. -974381586. 1521048264. 1.52e9 ## 4 Afghanistan trend_model 1963 751111191. -667605100. 1418716291. 1.42e9 ## 5 Afghanistan trend_model 1964 800000044. -360828613. 1160828658. 1.16e9 ## 6 Afghanistan trend_model 1965 1006666638. -54052127. 1060718765. 1.06e9 ## 7 Afghanistan trend_model 1966 1399999967. 252724359. 1147275607. 1.15e9 ## 8 Afghanistan trend_model 1967 1673333418. 559500846. 1113832572. 1.11e9 ## 9 Afghanistan trend_model 1968 1373333367. 866277332. 507056034. 5.07e8 ## 10 Afghanistan trend_model 1969 1408888922. 1173053819. 235835103. 2.36e8 ## # … with 15,140 more rows augment(fit) %&gt;% filter(Country == &quot;Sweden&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = .resid)) + geom_histogram(bins = 20) + ggtitle(&quot;Histogram of residuals&quot;) 20.2 Are the model residuals auto-correlated? augment(fit) %&gt;% filter(Country == &quot;Sweden&quot;) -&gt; augSweden augSweden %&gt;% ACF(.resid) %&gt;% autoplot() + ggtitle(&quot;ACF of residuals&quot;) augment(fit3) %&gt;% filter(Country == &quot;Sweden&quot;) -&gt; augSweden3 augSweden3 %&gt;% ACF(.resid) %&gt;% autoplot() + ggtitle(&quot;ACF of residuals&quot;) 20.3 Example: GDP, several models, several countries library(tsibbledata) # Data sets package nordic &lt;- c(&quot;Sweden&quot;, &quot;Denmark&quot;, &quot;Norway&quot;, &quot;Finland&quot;) (global_economy %&gt;% filter(Country %in% nordic) -&gt; nordic_economy) ## # A tsibble: 232 x 9 [1Y] ## # Key: Country [4] ## Country Code Year GDP Growth CPI Imports Exports Population ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Denmark DNK 1960 6248946880.

A.1 Course Description The course is designed to introduce graduate students and advanced undergraduates in engineering to time series and forecasting. The course will not include a deep exploration of theory. Rather, the goal is for students by the end to be able to analyze time series data competently, as part of their work designing and working with engineered systems. In addition to learning theory, each student will undertake a semester-long research project. Ideally, this project will relate closely to the student’s own dissertation research, professional practice, or other domain application that interests them. My hope is that these projects could form the basis for subsequent research papers, dissertation chapters, or other professional work products, for interested students. The course will, therefore, be structured primarily as a workshop: the ultimate goal is to help you to create a professionally presented report. Our workflow will, therefore, be subject to revision, according to my judgement of how best to use our time to help you produce a professional report. The course outline is divided into two major sections. First, we will introduce the theory, with examples. In the later part of the semester, we will focus on workshopping your projects in progress. Important: class readings are subject to change, contingent on mitigating circumstances and the progress we make as a class. Students are encouraged to attend lectures and check the course website for updates. A.1.1 Prerequisites Students should have taken at least one rigorous intermediate course in probability and statistics. They should be comfortable with the representation of uncertain information in the form of probability distributions, with conditional probabilities, and with other such foundational concepts. In addition, to carry out the data analyis, the student should have at least ability be able to code, in some general-purpose language. For this course, we will work in R, focusing on specialized packages for working with time series data and generating forecasts. A.1.2 Expectations Each student will make a presentation on their data analysis project. Students will be evaluated based on their performance in these presentations and on their final project, on occasional short quizzes; and on their contributions inside and outside of class towards helping other students. A.1.3 Readings The primary text for the course will be Forecasting: Principles and Practice, 3rd ed. by Rob J. Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos. This resource is available for free online and is linked from the Collab site. The text includes example code in R, and covers several useful R packages related to time series and forecasting. Additional readings including relevant articles will be provided as the course progresses. The choice of readings will depend in part on student interests, as conveyed through their choice of projects. A.1.4 Course Objectives Students will learn the foundations of time series and forecasting. Students will gain the experience of building statistical models of time series, and models for forecasting, and will learn how to evaluate their performance. Students will learn the concepts and practice of reproducible research, in the course of preparing a research paper. Students will gain experience in making presentations and in preparing a polished research article. A.1.5 Grading Policy 10% of your grade will be determined by quizzes designed to test your understanding of the theoretical concepts introduced in class. This quiz will delivered at roughly the mid-point of the semester. It will be open-book and open-notes, outside of class. You will have multiple days to complete it. The quiz will not be designed to be especially challenging: the goal is to give you the opportunity to synthesize your understanding of core concepts, in preparation for developing your data analysis for your research project. 10% of your grade will be determined by your performance in one in-class presentation based on your project. These presentations will be scheduled when you are, in the judgement of the instructor, far enough along to do so. 10% of your grade will be determined by your contributions to assist other students. These contributions can come through class participation, by making useful contributions in online forums (Github), or through other means that add value to the group experience. 70% of your grade will be determined by your performance on your final project. The development of the project will include multiple iterations, each with an associated deliverable: An initial Concept Note. A more developed Project Proposal. A first working draft of your final project paper. A final complete draft of your project paper. Details of these staged intermediate deliverables will be forthcoming. The final product should be a polished professional paper that meets academic standards regarding format, quality, and integrity. A.1.6 Attendance Policy Showing up is 80 percent of life – Woody Allen, via Marshall Brickman Regular attendance is very much in your pedagogic interest. However, it is up to you whether to attend in person or to view recorded class sessions afterwards. A.1.7 Communications protocols, including emails and office hours I prefer to avoid using email to communicate with students about class matters. For substantive questions about course materials and concepts, please use class time, office hours, or meetings by appointment. Please use email only for brief clarifying questions, or to set up appointments. A.1.8 Academic Dishonesty Policy Don’t cheat. Don’t plagiarize. Don’t present someone else’s work as your own. A.1.9 Disabilities Policy Together with the University of Virginia, I am committed to assuring that all students have the full opportunity to benefit from the course regardless of their disability status. If you have a disability that may require accommodations, please see the instructor early in the semester to work out appropriate arrangements. Xie, Yihui. 2015.
